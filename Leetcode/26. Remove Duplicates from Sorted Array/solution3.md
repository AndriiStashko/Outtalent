# Two Pointers

## Algorithm

Since the array is already sorted, we can keep two pointers i and j, where i is the slow-runner while j is the fast-runner. As long as nums[i]=nums[j], we increment j to skip the duplicate.

When we encounter nums[j] â‰  nums[i], the duplicate run has ended so we must copy its value to nums[i+1]. i is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until j reaches the end of array.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 0: return 0
        i = 0
        for j in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != nums[i]:
                i += 1
                nums[i] = nums[j]
        return i + 1
```

## Complexity analysis

* Time complextiy: O(n).

Assume that n is the length of array. Each of i and j traverses at most n steps.

* Space complexity: O(1).
