# Brute Force

The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element x and find if there is another value that equals to targetâˆ’x.

## Solutions:

* [Python](./solution1.py)
* [Java](./solution1.java)
* [C++](./solution1.cpp)

## Complexity Analysis

* Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>). 

For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of array which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>).

* Space complexity: O(1).
