# Behavioral Question Set 8

## Tell me a bit about your professional experience in 2-3 minutes.

* This question will allow you to get an initial sense of your peer’s experience.
* Feel free to ask follow-up questions, for instance, can you elaborate a bit more on your experience with [specific technology] or your responsibilities at [company]? You can also use this opportunity to ask the candidate which of their experiences had the greatest impact on them.

## What are you looking for in your next role?

* This is an opportunity to get insight into whether a candidate would be a good culture fit for your company. Is the candidate looking for a company of your size? Do their expectations match the role?

## What’s an example of a difficult problem you solved? Be specific about how the problem was diagnosed and your process for approaching it.

* Owner vs participant: Many candidates will claim they led a big project or created significant impact, but if you dig deeper, you’ll find that the candidate only played a participatory role or was involved in just one facet of the project. As an interviewer, it’s your role to uncover the truth. Follow-up questions asking about who was involved, what the candidate personally did, and how they did it will help you make an informed decision about the candidate’s true impact.
* Good vs great achievements: Many candidates are good at quantifying their achievements, but you’ll want to know how big of an impact this achievement actually had. Was it a minor success or did it have a significant impact? Were the results due to the candidate’s impact, or would those results have likely occurred without their involvement? You may consider asking follow-up questions here too: try to drill down into the baseline metrics used, such as “What were the projected metrics had you not made this decision?”

## Give me a specific example of a time when you sold your supervisor or team on an idea or concept. How did you convince them? What was the result?

* This question is about teamwork and influence. You want to dig into the candidate’s ability to reason and listen to their superior, navigate a difference of opinion, and ultimately, show how they resolved the disagreement.

## Tell me about a time when your work responsibilities got a bit overwhelming. What did you do?

* This question allows you to get insight into how the candidate works under pressure and how they manage their time. It’s an opportunity for the candidate to highlight specific examples of working well under pressure. Try to drill down into any examples when it seems that the situation could’ve been prevented, due to procrastination, etc.

## How do you stay up to date with the latest technologies?

* This question is about getting a sense of the candidate’s growth mindset – whether they’re invested in continuous learning and personal improvement.
* Drill down into how and where they go to stay up-to-date.
